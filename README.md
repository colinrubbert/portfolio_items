### PC Mechanics
Site: [PC Mechanics](http://pcmneenah.com/)

The Stack:

- Squarespace
- Custom JavaScript

##### The Problem:

The company had a very outdated, non-mobile friendly website that was not updated frequently. There was a lack of interaction and the ability to reach out to the actual business.

##### The Solution:

Rebuild the website with mobile first in mind. Add pricing to reduce inbound calls about cost, add easily to find contact information, add a web form that potential customers could easily contact the company, and include an ability to make payments online for remote jobs.

##### The Results:

- 180% increase in page visits
- Top ranked Google search result
- 14% increased revenue solely from web traffic
- Decreased phone calls asking about pricing and increased phone calls scheduling services

### Firehose Lightning Talks
Site: [Lightning Talks Web App](http://firehoselightning.herokuapp.com/)

Code: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/FirehoseCommunity/LightningTalkTopics)

The Stack:

- HTML/CSS/Sass
- Ruby/Rails/rspec
- jQuery
- PostgreSQL
- Heroku (free dyno)

##### The Problem:

Build a platform where remote students of The Firehose Project bootcamp could come together and share knowledge about web development related topics.

##### The Solution:

The intent of the Lightning Talks was to get remote students involved in "remote meetups" since many students lived in remote areas that didn't have a developer community to interact with. In addition to getting students to leave their comfort zone and the standard Firehose Project curriculum it was desiged to get students comfortable with talking about technology in front of people that included a recorded video that could be shared with potential employers. The project itself would be open sourced so that students could also get used to contributing to a code base and work as a team.

##### The Results:

- 56 Videos w/5,325 YouTube views
- 10 Open Source Contributors
- Regular interest in for new students to showcase their interests

### Colin Rubbert (My Personal Site)
Site: [Personal Site](http://colinrubbert.com/)

Code: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/colinrubbert/personal-site)

The Stack:

- HTML/CSS/Sass
- Ruby/Jekyll
- jQuery
- Cloud Cannon Jekyll CMS Hosting

##### The Problem:

Convert Squarespace website to Jekyll static site. Build a website that showcases my writing/bloggig as well as my photography.

##### The Solution:

Gain control over actual code and migrateable platform. Squarespace caused a lot of issues in regards to customizing and controlling my content. Jekyll would be a platform where I could control my information more closely, design the website in the manner that I wanted to, and be able to present information in a way I wanted. 

** Site will be undergoing a redesign and refocus in the coming month **

##### The Results:

- Increased traffic
- Increased control over assets
- Knowledge of a new framework and CMS

##### The Problem:

Create a website to funnel freelance/contract gigs for web design work.

Build a JavaScript website pricing calculator to weed out "race to the bottome" customers and focus on customers that are serious about their website and their online prescence. 

** Site will be undergoing an expansion in the coming months **

##### The Results:

- Establish a place on the internet for my business
- Gained business leads
- Added newsletter subscribers for future information and outreach
